this version of the program requires a minimum of five hundred and twelve kilobytes of ram and runs on the
mac five hundred and twelve mac plus mac and mac i was unable to test compatibility with
 the other two macs but it should work fine with these
machines as well the five hundred and twelve kilobyte macs require two floppy drives or a hard disk the
program uses key disk protection

where in europe is carmen sandiego is an interesting educational and
all around fun game that looks and plays great it should make an excellent
